This is made possible by representing the simpler components as thermodynamically open systems exchanging mass and energy via ports. A key feature of this approach is that the resultant models are robustly thermodynamically compliant: the thermodynamic compliance is not dependent on precise numerical values of parameters. Moreover, the models are reusable due to the well-defined interface provided by the energy ports.\r\n\r\nTo extract bond graph model parameters from parameters found in the literature, general and compact formulae are developed to relate free-energy constants and equilibrium constants. The existence and uniqueness of solutions is considered in terms of fundamental properties of stoichiometric matrices. The approach is illustrated by building a hierarchical bond graph model of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle. \r\n\r\n## How do I see the results and work with the code?\r\nWe suggest you use the Virtual Reference Environment for the project (what is this?), built using [Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com).  To do this, install [Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/hbgm_vagrant.git\r\n$ vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

This is made possible by representing the simpler components as thermodynamically open systems exchanging mass and energy via ports. A key feature of this approach is that the resultant models are robustly thermodynamically compliant: the thermodynamic compliance is not dependent on precise numerical values of parameters. Moreover, the models are reusable due to the well-defined interface provided by the energy ports.\r\n\r\nTo extract bond graph model parameters from parameters found in the literature, general and compact formulae are developed to relate free-energy constants and equilibrium constants. The existence and uniqueness of solutions is considered in terms of fundamental properties of stoichiometric matrices. The approach is illustrated by building a hierarchical bond graph model of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle. \r\n\r\n## Where is the publication?\r\n[Here is the arXiv link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01814)\r\n\r\n## How do I see the results and work with the code?\r\nWe suggest you use the Virtual Reference Environment for the project (what is this?), built using [Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com).  To do this, first install [Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/hbgm_vagrant.git\r\n$ cd hbgm_vagrant\r\n$ vagrant up\r\n```\r\nThis will get the code for this project and build a virtual environment with scripts you can run to reproduce the computations and figures in the publication.  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

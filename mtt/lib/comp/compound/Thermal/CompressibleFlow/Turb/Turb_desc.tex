   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Turb} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Turb_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Turb_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Turb_sub}.

\textbf{Turb} represents an ideal turbine component for compressible
or incompressible flow though a pipe.

It is identical to the \textbf{Pump} component (which has a more
complete description) exept for the direction of work flow.

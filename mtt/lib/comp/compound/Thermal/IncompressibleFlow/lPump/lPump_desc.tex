   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{lPump} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{lPump_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:lPump_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:lPump_sub}.

\textbf{lPump} corrsponds to the \textbf{Pump} component but with a
backflow leakage around the ump driven by the pressure drop across
the pump. This leakage is implemented using the \textbf{Pipe}
component to give the correct thermal behaviour.

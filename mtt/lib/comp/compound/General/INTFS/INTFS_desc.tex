   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{INTFS} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{INTFS_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:INTFS_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:INTFS_sub}.

   is the integral of the flow on port [in]. The single parameter e_0
   is the initial value of the integral.
